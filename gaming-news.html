                <h2>New Expansion for Elden Ring Announced</h2>
                <p>The latest expansion for Elden Ring has been officially revealed, promising new dungeons, bosses, and regions to explore and is priced at $40. It'll be available for all the platforms Elden Ring was released for: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox One X/S.</p>
                <p>That may seem steep for a DLC, but the game's studio FromSoftware has earned players' faith with popular expansions for prior games including Dark Souls and Bloodborne. Then there's Elden Ring itself, which was a massive success that won many awards when it launched in 2022 with so many areas, bosses, weapons and dungeons to explore that playthroughs often exceed a hundred hours. Players have been eager for new content.</p>
                <p>But not everyone's ready for the DLC, it seems. We know that you have to beat two bosses to access the expansion, but the global playerbase is lagging in defeating them: according to Steam's global lists of achievements, over 45% of players still haven't beaten Starscourage Radahn, while over 61% haven't beaten Mohg, Lord of Blood -- even hours before the DLC is about to come out. That doesn't take into account console players, but still -- time to get cracking, players.</p>

                <h2>God of War Ragnarok Wins at BAFTA Game Awards</h2>
                <p>God of War Ragnorok made good on its record-breaking haul of BAFTA Games Awards nominations by emerging with the largest number of gongs from the 2023 ceremony. </p>
                <p>Held on Thursday night in London’s Queen Elizabeth Hall on the Southbank (and livestreamed on Twitch), the event — hosted by Julia Hardy and Inel Tomlinson — saw Sony’s bloody battle into Norse mythology win six awards, including performance honors for Christopher Judge and Laya DeLeon Hayes and Game of the Year, the only award voted for by the public. The game — the sequel to 2019’s God of War (itself a BAFTA Game of the Year winner) — had gone into the night with 14 nominations.</p>
                <p>However, in something of a major shock, indie shooter Vampire Survivors — a title largely solely developed by Luca Galante — landed the top best game prize.</p>

                <h2>Cyberpunk 2077 Sequel Officially in Development</h2>
                <p>CD Projekt Red has announced that a sequel to Cyberpunk 2077 is in development. The developers aim to build on the success of the game's recent updates and expansions.</p>
                <p>Cyberpunk 2077 from developer CD Projekt Red had a challenging start when it was released in December 2020--the issues were so bad that Sony removed the game from sale entirely on the PlayStation Store. But the game rebounded in a very meaningful way and went on to become a critical and a commercial success. In fact, following the 2.0 update and release of the Phantom Liberty expansion, it's one of the best comeback stories in modern times for games.</p>
                <p>With more than 25 million units sold, it's one of the most successful video games in history. Naturally, CD Projekt Red is moving ahead with a sequel that's in development right now at one of the team's newest studios.</p>
                <p>Cyberpunk 2077 was announced in 2012 and wouldn't be released until eight years later. So fans should get comfortable as they await the sequel.</p>
